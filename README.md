# 🧠 NLP Wiki

Welcome to **NLP Wiki** — a curated collection of resources, research materials, and practical guides on Natural Language Processing (NLP).  
This repository serves as a knowledge base for my research group exploring topics such as embeddings, transformers, datasets, evaluation metrics, and multilingual NLP research.
